                <h3>Andrew Ryan</h3>
                <p>Our creater of the Rapture Trane Andrew Ryan. Andrew Ryan was born Andrei Rianofski in a village near Minsk in Russia (modern Belarus), during the time when the Tsar still held autocratic rule over that country. In 1917 he witnessed the Russian Revolution, which eventually brought the Bolsheviks into power.</p>
                <p>Ryan's experiences under Soviet rule led him to his personal philosophy: the modern world was created by great men who strove to make their own way. Any time "parasites" gained control of such a world, they destroyed it (as the Soviets did "trading one lie for another", the autocratic rule of the Czar for the repressions of Bolshevism). As a boy In 1919, he fled Russia to go to America, believing it to be a place where a great man could prosper. He anglicized his name to Andrew Ryan.</p>

                <h3>Big Dadddy</h3>
                <p>Big Daddies were originally created by Dr. Yi Suchong to serve as Rapture's maintenance workers and to help in later construction projects; Rosies riveted panels and windows and Bouncers drilled deep sea rocks for expansion of the city.</p>
                <p>Big Daddies (originally named Protectors, and occasionally referred to as Mister Bubbles by Little Sisters) are genetically enhanced human beings who have had their skin and organs grafted into an enormous diving suit, with Alpha Series being an apparent exception to the grafting process.</p>

                <h3>Rapture</h3>
                <p>Rapture lies at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, as a metropolis of massive Art Deco-styled[1] buildings, connected by networks of reinforced glass tunnels, bathysphere transport systems, and submerged railways. It largely resembles the Manhattan borough of New York in general appearance. The city is completely self-sustaining with its electricity, food production, water purification, manufacturing, and defense systems powered by the geothermal volcanic vents in Hephaestus. Fresh food and oxygen recycling are taken care of by large areas of cultivated forests and farms centralized in the Arcadia zone, as well as fish and other sea life from Neptune's Bounty.</p>
                <p>Transportation within Rapture is mainly provided by Rapture Metro, a public transportation system consisting of bathyspheres and tram cars, in which citizens access most areas of the city.</p>
                <p>One terminus of the Rapture Metro system is the bathysphere dock inside the remote lighthouse in the North Atlantic, which is Rapture's primary entrance to the outside world. Another mode of transportation within Rapture is the Atlantic Express, a pressurized rail system for moving a larger number of citizens (though this mode of transportation was mostly decommissioned years before the time of Bioshock 1). Adjacent areas of Rapture are connected through bulkhead doors. Areas within some levels are connected by glass tunnels: small ones for pedestrians, larger ones for a system of railed tramways. Rapture is intentionally isolated from the world, and the primary way to access it was using bathyspheres which travel down from the lighthouse perched on an island above.</p>
